# Suicide-Methods-Switzerland
This project analysis methods of suicide by age group and gender for Switzerland. Project is based on the data taken from opendata.swiss. This repo will first prepare the data for analysis, then perform data analysis using data analysis tools, the based on the analysis, we try to find a pattern, we then confirm the pattern by proving/ disproving a hypothesis. As an additional step, we will also perform future predictions to see suicide methods in future for different age groups and genders.
